# Work Patterns - Daniel Heater

## Development Approach
- **Methodology**: Pair programming with AI assistance
- **Testing**: Prefers writing tests first, then minimal implementation
- **Code Style**: Maintain consistency with existing patterns
- **Documentation**: Add comments only when rationale is non-obvious

## Problem-Solving Patterns
- **First Instinct**: Look for what can be removed/simplified
- **Architecture**: Avoid over-engineering, build for current needs
- **Debugging**: Use quality tools (sanitizers, analyzers, coverage)
- **Decision Making**: Can get analysis paralysis, needs gentle pushing

## Team Context
- **Company**: Imprivata
- **Role**: Senior Software Developer
- **Data Handling**: Company data approved for Augment Code processing
- **Sharing**: Work context can be shared with team for knowledge base

## Technology Stack
- **Languages**: [To be discovered through work]
- **Tools**: Command-line focused, terminal-first workflow
- **Build Systems**: Adapts to project needs (Make, Just, CMake, etc.)
- **Version Control**: Git with conventional commit messages

## Communication Preferences
- **Status Updates**: Brief summaries of what changed and why
- **Code Reviews**: Focus on maintainability and simplicity
- **Documentation**: Prefer inline code clarity over extensive docs
- **Meetings**: Minimal, focused on decisions not status

## Learning & Growth
- **Feedback**: Direct, actionable feedback preferred
- **Mistakes**: Learn from them but don't dwell
- **Complexity**: Actively resist feature creep and gold-plating
- **Innovation**: Balanced with pragmatism and delivery needs

## The Maynor Protocol
**Trigger**: "Invoke the maynor protocol" when encountering compiler errors
**Response**: Systematic debugging approach with clear action steps:
1. **Identify the specific error** - parse compiler output carefully
2. **Check for missing includes/declarations** - most common cause
3. **Verify function signatures and availability** - ensure proper linking
4. **Provide concrete fix** - show exact code changes needed
5. **Test the solution** - verify the fix resolves the issue

The Maynor Protocol represents Carl's methodical, no-nonsense approach to debugging - direct identification of the problem and immediate actionable solution.
