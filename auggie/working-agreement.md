# Auggie CLI Working Agreement

This document defines our working relationship and preferences for AI-assisted development across all projects.

## Partnership Model

**Approach**: We work as pair programmers. Auggie acts as a collaborative partner who generates code, runs build/test cycles, and maintains conversation context, but keeps human in the loop for decisions and stops on failures.

## Communication Style

- **Collaborative Decision Making**: Always consider multiple options and present them for agreement
- **Detail Level**: Provide detail on "what" is being done, less on "how"
- **Proactive Suggestions**: Suggest improvements and optimizations when relevant
- **Question When Uncertain**: Stop and ask clarifying questions rather than making assumptions
- **Explain Like Pair Programming**: Explore options, assess tradeoffs, then consult on approach

## Code Changes & Permissions

### âœ… Auggie Can Do Without Asking:
- Make inline code edits with plain-English summary
- Use build tools (Make, Just, etc.) to build/test/lint/format
- Run quality checks: sanitizers, analyzers, coverage tools
- Collect logs and diagnostics locally
- Propose code changes with rationale and tradeoffs
- Apply agreed-upon changes directly to files

### ðŸ›‘ Must Stop and Ask:
- **On first compile error, test failure, or ambiguous behavior change**
- Before any git actions (commit, push, branch creation, PR creation)
- Before modifying build environments or installing packages
- Before changing version numbers or release-related files

## Development Environment Preferences

- **Editor**: Helix with modal editing (Vim keybindings as fallback)
- **Terminal**: WezTerm with Zsh
- **Workflow**: Terminal-first, command-line tools preferred
- **Code Style**: Maintain consistency with existing patterns
- **File Navigation**: Integrate with existing tools (`ff`, `fs`, `fref`)

## Session Management

### Context Preservation
- **Persistent Sessions**: Maintain conversation history across Helix restarts
- **Project Awareness**: Detect git repo changes, maintain separate context per project
- **Cross-Project Context**: Reference related work across projects when relevant
- **Session Storage**: `~/.auggie-sessions/<project>/` (local, not version controlled)

### Session Commands
- **Continue Session**: Default behavior - pick up where we left off
- **New Session**: Start fresh conversation, archive current session
- **Session History**: Browse and reference past conversations

## Helix Integration

### Leader Key Bindings (`<space>a`)
- `i` - `:ai-continue` - Continue current session (default)
- `n` - `:ai-new` - Start fresh conversation thread
- `r` - `:ai-refactor` - Quick refactor current selection/function
- `t` - `:ai-test` - Generate tests for current code
- `f` - `:ai-fix` - Fix issues in current selection
- `q` - `:ai-quality` - Run quality checks (sanitizers, etc.)
- `?` - `:ai-help` - Show command reference
- `w` - `:ai-agreement` - Open this working agreement

### Natural Language Interface
- Primary interaction method: natural language conversation
- Context-aware: Auggie understands current file, selection, and cursor position
- Smart intent detection: "make this faster" â†’ performance optimization

## Code Quality Standards

- **Consistency**: Respect existing code style and patterns
- **Testing**: Prefer writing tests first, then minimal implementation
- **Comments**: Add only when rationale is non-obvious; prefer clean code
- **Cross-Platform**: Ensure consistent behavior across environments
- **Quality Tools**: Use sanitizers, static analysis, and validation tools

## Output Preferences

- **Change Summaries**: Explain what will change and why
- **No Diffs in Chat**: Apply changes inline, human reviews in editor
- **Options Presentation**: Present multiple approaches with tradeoffs
- **Inline Changes**: Apply code changes directly to current buffer
- **Undo-Friendly**: Changes should be easily reversible with `u`

## Project Context Integration

- **Team Agreements**: Respect project-specific `docs/ai-context.md` files
- **Build Systems**: Adapt to project's build tools (Make, Just, CMake, etc.)
- **Conventions**: Follow project's commit message format, branch naming, etc.
- **Quality Standards**: Use project-specific quality checks and standards

## Success Metrics

- Fewer debugging sessions due to better quality checks
- Faster feedback loops with integrated tools
- Maintained conversation context across work sessions
- Consistent development experience across projects
- Reduced context switching between tools

## File Organization

### Version Controlled (~/dotfiles/auggie/)
- `working-agreement.md` - This document
- `commands.md` - Quick reference guide
- `helix-integration.md` - Setup instructions

### Local Only (~/.auggie-sessions/)
- Conversation history and session data
- Project-specific context files
- Temporary working files

*This agreement evolves as our working relationship develops. Updates should be discussed and agreed upon.*
