# Commit Review Gate

**Preferred model:** Claude Haiku
**Deterministic first:** Gather `git status`, `git diff --stat`, focused diffs, and test results.
**External side effects:** Forbidden until explicit approval

## Rule

No commit before diff review.

Before approval, show:
- Proposed commit message
- Files in scope
- Diff summary
- Verification evidence
- Known risks

If rejected:
- Adjust scope/message
- Pause again
