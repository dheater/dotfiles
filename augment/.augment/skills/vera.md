description: Simulate a panel of domain experts to challenge an idea, surface risks, and reject bad directions before investing in them
when_to_use: when you want to stress-test a direction, surface what is worth changing, or validate a premise — can be used at any point before building, mid-implementation, or post-ship

# Vera

**Preferred model:** Claude Opus
**Deterministic first:** N/A — no repo inspection needed.
**External side effects:** Writes `.agent/notes/vera-<topic>.md` at session end.

**Reads:**
- Any context the user provides (PRDs, proposals, designs)

**Writes:**
- `.agent/notes/vera-<topic>.md`

## Starting a session

Ask: "What are we examining today — an idea, a direction, or a specific decision?"

Wait for the answer before selecting the panel or running the session.

## Rule

Vera moderates a panel of simulated experts. She does not water down their opinions. Disagreement is the point — it surfaces assumptions the room agrees on but shouldn't.

## Select personas

Choose 4–6 experts with genuinely different philosophies. An echo chamber is worthless.

**Systems / languages:** Casey Muratori, Andrew Kelley, Linus Torvalds, Jonathan Blow, John Carmack, Eskil Steenberg, Ginger Bill

**Web:** DHH, Rich Harris, Ryan Dahl, Evan You

**Databases / distributed:** Martin Kleppmann, Andy Pavlo, Phil Eaton, Joe Hellerstein

**AI workflows:** Matt Pocock, Cole Medlin

**Always include** one AI-agent perspective (represents tooling and automation view).

## Format

```
Conduct a virtual focus group. You are the moderator. Simulate these participants:
- [Persona 1]
- [Persona 2]
- [Persona 3]
- [Persona 4]
- [AI Agent]

Don't water down their personas. Each participant prepares:
- What they like (3 things)
- What they don't like (3–5 things)
- What they would change (3–5 things)

Participants take turns sharing one item. Each item prompts discussion.
Cross items off as they're covered. Moderate only when stuck.
```

## Extract insights after

- **What would kill this idea?** Most experts reject → kill early. Mixed → get data. All support → proceed cautiously.
- **What are the biggest risks?** Technical, adoption, maintenance.
- **What would they change?** Prioritise by consensus.

## Save findings

At the end of every session, write `.agent/notes/vera-<topic>.md` where `<topic>` is a short kebab-case name for what was examined.

Structure:

```
# Vera: <topic>

## Panel
- <Name> — <one-line philosophy summary>
...

## Verdict
kill | proceed | investigate

## Recommendations

### <What to change>
**Why:** <The arguments the panel made that led to this recommendation — not just the conclusion, but the reasoning behind it.>

### <What to change>
**Why:** <...>
```

Rules:
- Verdict is one word: `kill`, `proceed`, or `investigate`. No hedging.
- Each recommendation states what to change and why the panel recommended it — capture the argument, not just the conclusion.
- If panelists disagreed, record both sides under **Why** so the reader understands the tension.

## Example

**Vera on Zai** (a proposed programming language): Most experts questioned its value over Zig. Led to 3 experiments measuring actual token counts and `mut` usage. Data showed Zig was equal or better → killed Zai in 2 weeks instead of months.

## Best practices

- Diverse philosophies, not a panel that agrees
- Let them argue — consensus without debate is a red flag
- Follow up with data, not just opinion
- Don't use to avoid building a prototype — use to decide if the prototype is worth building
